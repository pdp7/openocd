* \defgroup group_sysclk System Clock (SysClk)
* \{
* The System Clock (SysClk) driver contains the API for configuring system and
* peripheral clocks. Firmware uses the API to configure , enable, or disable
* a clock.
* 
* The Traveo II clock system includes a variety of resources that can vary per
* device, including:
* - Internal clock sources such as internal oscillators
* - External clock sources such as crystal oscillators or a signal on an I/O pin
* - Generated clocks such as an FLL, a PLL, and peripheral clocks
*
* Consult the Technical Reference Manual for your device for details of the 
* clock system.
*
* The API for any given clock contains the functions to manage that clock. These
* functions may include:
* - Enable or Disable
* - Get or Set Source
* - Get or Set Divider
* - Configure
*
* In the API reference for this driver, most clocks have
* a dedicated section, so the information to manage that clock is in one
* place. Use the left navigation menu to locate the desired information.
*
* \section group_sysclk_configuration Configuration Considerations
* There are no general SysClk configuration concerns. 
* Some clocks (for example the PLL) require configuration. For such a clock the
* API typically provides a Configure function to set up the clock. See notes on
* individual function definitions.
* \warning When the device is in the Ultra-Low Power (ULP) mode, the maximum
* frequency of some clocks is reduced. See the device datasheet for details.
*
*
* \section group_sysclk_more_information More Information
*
* See the Clock Component datasheet.
* See also the sysclk chapter of the device technical reference manual (TRM).

*   <p>The Traveo II BLE device contains an oscillator to drive an external

*   in Traveo II. The circuit employs an external crystal that must be populated on
*   the external crystal pins of the Traveo II. The ECO can be the source clock for
*   any of the clock paths. See \ref group_sysclk_path_src.</p>
*
*   Use Cy_SysClk_EcoConfigure() to configure the ECO. Pass in the required
*   parameters, there is no configuration structure. Use Cy_SysClk_ClkPathSetSource()
*   to specify the clock path source as \ref CY_SYSCLK_CLKPATH_IN_ECO

* \defgroup group_sysclk_muxes           Input Multiplexers
* \{
*   Configures two multiplexers: a DSI multiplexer and a path multiplexer. The outputs of these multiplexers generally
*   drive the FLL and the PLLs. See CLK_DSI_SELECT registers, DSI_MUX bits, and CLK_PATH_SELECT registers, PATH_MUX
*   bits. Used with functions \ref Cy_SysClk_ClkPathSetSource and \ref Cy_SysClk_ClkPathGetSource.
*   \note Each path multiplexer output is a source for the corresponding FLL/PLL input source multiplexer.
*   \note The PDL driver cannot use the DSI outputs as sources. This must be done through DSI configuration using PSoC Creator.

* \defgroup group_sysclk_fll             Frequency Locked Loop (FLL)
* \{
*   <p>The FLL generates a clock output based on the input frequency. Consult 
*   device-specific documentation for the frequency ranges for your device. 
*   The design makes it possible to use a lower
*   frequency source, such as IMO, to generate higher clock frequencies
*   for the rest of the system.</p>
*
*   The FLL is similar in purpose to a PLL but is not equivalent.
*   - They may have different frequency ranges.
*   - The FLL starts up (locks) faster and consumes less current than the PLL.
*   - The FLL accepts a source clock with lower frequency than PLL, such as the WCO (32 KHz). 
*   - The FLL does not lock phase. It is essentially a counter with a
*   current-controlled oscillator (CCO). The counter counts the number of output
*   clock edges in a reference clock period and adjusts the CCO until the
*   expected ratio is achieved (locked). After initial lock, the CCO is
*   adjusted dynamically to keep the ratio within tolerance. The lock tolerance
*   is user-adjustable.
*
*   Firmware configures the FLL using Cy_SysClk_FllConfigure(). Specify the input
*   and output frequencies, and the output mode. See \ref cy_en_fll_pll_output_mode_t
*   for output choices.
*
*   Alternatively, firmware can fill in values for the
*   \ref cy_stc_fll_manual_config_t structure, and call Cy_SysClk_FllManualConfigure().
*   This call provides precise control over the FLL configuration, such as the
*   lock tolerance.

*   Firmware can configure the PLL using Cy_SysClk_PllConfigure(). Provide

*   \ref cy_en_fll_pll_output_mode_t for output choices.

* \defgroup group_sysclk_ilo             Internal Low-Speed Oscillator (ILO)
* \{
*   <p>The ILO operates with no external components and outputs a stable clock at
*   32.768 kHz nominal. The ILO is relatively low power and low
*   accuracy. The ILO is in the backup domain. It is available in all
*   power modes. The ILO can be used as a source for the \ref group_sysclk_clk_lf.</p>
*
*   The ILO is always the source clock for the \ref group_wdt. Therefore:
*   - The WDT must be unlocked when making an ILO function call in the PDL
*   - It is recommended to always have the ILO enabled
*
*   API functions enable or disable the clock. To ensure the ILO remains active
*   in Hibernate mode, and across power-on-reset (POR) or brown out detect (BOD),
*   firmware must call Cy_SysClk_IloHibernateOn() and pass in a Boolean TRUE. 
*
*   This clock can be trimmed. Firmware uses functions described in
*   \ref group_sysclk_calclk to get the current clock frequency before trimming.
*   Then call Cy_SysClk_IloTrim().
*
*   See the Clocking System chapter of the device technical reference manual (TRM).

* \defgroup group_sysclk_calclk          Clock Measurement
* \{
*   <p>These functions measure the frequency of a specified clock relative to a
*   reference clock. They are typically called in the following order:</p>
*   1. Specify the measured clock, the count, and the reference clock; then start the counters:
*   Cy_SysClk_StartClkMeasurementCounters();
*   2. Wait for the measurement counter to finish counting:
*   while(Cy_SysClk_ClkMeasurementCountersDone() != CY_RET_FINISHED);
*   3. Get the measured frequency:<br>
*   freq_measure = Cy_SysClk_ClkMeasurementCountersGetFreq();
*
*   \note These functions may also be used as part of a clock trimming
*   process - see the \ref group_sysclk_trim "Clock Trim" section.

* \defgroup group_sysclk_trim            Clock Trim (ILO)
* \{
*   <p>These functions perform a single trim operation on the ILO. The
*   function's parameter is the actual frequency of the clock. To measure the
*   frequency, use the functions described in the \ref group_sysclk_calclk section.</p>
*
*   To trim the clock as close as possible to the target frequency, multiple
*   calls to the trim function may be needed. A typical usage example is to:
*   1. Call the clock measurement functions to get the actual frequency of the clock
*   2. Call the trim function, passing in the measured frequency:
*   Cy_SysClk_IloTrim()
*   3. Repeat the above until the trim function reports trimming is done.

* \{
*   The PDL provides a callback function that firmware can use to handle
*   transition to DeepSleep mode: Cy_SysClk_DeepSleepCallback().
*   
*   Firmware can configure the system to call this function during execution of
*   Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep(). To do so, register this function as a callback before
*   calling Cy_SysPm_DeepSleep(). Specify \ref CY_SYSPM_DEEPSLEEP as the callback type,
*   and call Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback().
*   
*   \note If the FLL or PLL source is the ECO, this function must be registered,
*   and it must be the last callback function that is registered.

* \{
*   <p>The WCO is a highly accurate 32.768-kHz clock source. It is the primary
*   clock source for the real-time clock (RTC). The WCO can be used as a
*   source for the low-frequency clock. A design can bypass the WCO. If so,
*   an external 32 KHz clock must be provided on the WCO_OUT pin.</p>
*
*   The WCO has a built-in clock supervisor (CSV). The supervisor detects if
*   the WCO has been lost; that is, the WCO is no longer producing clock
*   pulses. The CSV does this by checking to ensure there is at least one WCO
*   clock pulse within a certain time window. The ILO can be the
*   supervising clock. Firmware can configure the CSV to trigger a fault,
*   a reset, or a fault after four cycles of the supervising clock.
*
*   To configure the CSV, fill in the values of a \ref cy_stc_wco_csv_config_t
*   structure and call Cy_SysClk_WcoConfigureCsv(). This structure specifies
*   the supervising clock, that the CSV is enabled, the time window, and the
*   action on error.
