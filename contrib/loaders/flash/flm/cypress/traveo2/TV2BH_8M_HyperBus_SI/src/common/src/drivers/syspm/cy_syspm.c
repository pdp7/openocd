/*******************************************************************************
* Function Name: Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode
****************************************************************************//**
*
* Sets device into the low power mode.
*
* The low power (LPActive/LPSleep) modes are similar to the active/sleep modes.
* The difference is that the current is limited and some functions have limited 
* features/performance.
*
* The feature of the low power mode is the limited current. Restrictions are 
* placed on the clock frequencies and allow the peripherals to achieve 
* a current limit.
*
* Before entering the low power mode, the user should configure the system so 
* the total current drawn from Vccd is less that the value presented in the 
* technical reference manual (TRM). Refer to the TRM for the maximum load for 
* low power operation and clock limitations in the low power mode with different
* core supply regulator voltages.
*
* * Peripherals can use the knowledge of the LPActive/LPSleep mode to make
* trade-offs that consume less current. For more details, see the corresponding
* peripherals' datasheet.
* * High-speed clock sources are available with the appropriate pre-divider 
* settings to limit the system current.
* Refer to the TRM for the maximum frequency values for low power operation 
* using different Core Regulators output voltages.
*
* Puts the device into the low power mode. Prior to entering the low power mode,
* all the registered CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY 
* parameter are called. This allows the driver to signal if it is not ready to 
* enter the low power mode. If any CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter call returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL, the remaining
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter 
* calls are skipped.
*
* After a CY_SYSPM_FAIL all of the CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter are executed that correspond to the 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY parameter calls 
* that occurred up to the point of failure. Low Power mode is not entered and 
* the Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode() function returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL.
*
* If all CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY 
* parameter calls return CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS, then all CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE 
* callbacks with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL calls are skipped and all 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION parameter 
* calls are executed. This allows the peripherals to prepare for low power.
* The low power mode is then entered.
*
* After entering the low power mode, all of the registered 
* CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION parameter 
* are executed to complete preparing the peripherals for low power operation. 
* The Cy_SysPm_EnterLpMode() function returns CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS. 
* No CY_SYSPM_ENTER_LP_MODE callbacks with the CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION or 
* CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION parameter are executed, if the low power mode is not 
* entered.
*
* \note The last callback which returned CY_SYSPM_FAIL is not executed with 
* the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL parameter because of the FAIL.
*
* The return values from executed callback functions with the 
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL, CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION, and CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION
* modes are ignored.
*
* \note The callbacks are not executed if the device is already not in 
* the low power mode.
*
* \return
* See \ref cy_en_syspm_status_t. <br>
* CY_SYSPM_SUCCESS - Entered the LPActive mode or the device is already 
* in LPActive.<br>

    *
    * Switch the power supply regulator to Single-Input Multiple Output (SIMO) 
    * Buck regulator instead of Linear regulator. The SIMO Buck core regulator 
    * can supply Vccd with higher efficiency than the Linear core regulator (LDO)
    * under some conditions, such as high external supply voltage.
    *
    * Before changing from LDO to SIMO Buck, ensure that:
    * * The circuit board has connected Vccbuck1 to Vccd and also populated the 
    * necessary external components for the SIMO Buck regulator, including an 
    * inductor and a capacitor for each output.
    * Refer to the device TRM for more details.
    *
    * * The operating frequency is reduced so it is within the static timing 
    * closure limits at the new frequency.
    * 
    * * The current consumption on the core is reduced to meet the 0.9 V (nominal)
    * output voltage. The main reason is that while changing from LDO to SIMO Buck,
    * the switch happens at 0.9 V (nominal).
    *
    * * The appropriate Wait states values are set for Flash using the 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function. Refer to the System Library (syslib) 
    * driver for more details.
    *
    * In general, use the next sequence to obtain SIMO Buck 0.9 V (nominal):
    * 1) Set the appropriate Wait states for ULP by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(true, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz.
    * 
    * 2) Set 0.9 V (nominal) for the LDO regulator.
    *
    * 3) Switch the regulators by calling the Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() function.
    *
    * To obtain SIMO Buck 1.1 V (nominal) use the next sequence:
    * 1) Set the appropriate Wait states for ULP by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(true, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz
    * 
    * 2) Set 0.9 V (nominal) for the LDO regulator.
    *
    * 3) Switch the regulators by calling the Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() function.
    *
    * 4) Change the SIMO Buck output voltage by calling the 
    * Cy_SysPm_SimoBuckSetVoltage1(CY_SYSPM_SIMO_BUCK_OUT1_VOLTAGE_1_1V).
    *
    * 5) Set the appropriate Wait states for LP by calling 
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates(false, hfClkFreqMz), where hfClkFreqMz -
    * the desired frequency of HfClk0 in MHz
    *
    * \warning The system cannot recognize when Vccd is settled at actual
    * 0.9 V or 1.1 V for transition, because this voltage depends on the conditions 
    * including the load current. The firmware works with the 
    * nominal 0.9 V and 1.1 V voltages.
    *
    * \warning The Flash access time when the core
    * output voltage is 0.9 V (nominal) is longer than at 1.1 V (nominal). 
    * Therefore, the clock to the Flash should be decreased. Use the
    * Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function to set the appropriate Wait state values 
    * for Flash. Call the Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function before 
    * Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() if you want to change the voltage 
    * to 0.9 V (nominal). Call the Cy_SysLib_SetWaitStates() function after 
    * Cy_SysPm_SwitchToSimoBuck() if you change the voltage from 0.9 V (nominal)
    * to 1.1 V (nominal).
    * 
    * \warning There is no way to go back to the Linear regulator after the SIMO 
    * Buck regulator supplies a core. The function switches off the LDO.
    *
    * In addition, if the 0.9 V (nominal) output is set, the Flash works 
    * in the Read-only operation.
    *
    * If the 1.1 V (nominal) output is set, the Flash works in the Read and Write 
    * operation and clock frequencies may be increased up to the static 
    * timing closure limits for a new voltage. 
    * Refer to the device TRM for more details.
